I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Columbia University and a 2022--2023 job market candidate. I previously received a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Hong Kong. My research interests include Applied Microeconomics, Family Economics and Health and Education.

I hope to use my economics training to make real-world impact, and broaden my perspective by working with people from different backgrounds and with different skill sets.
