I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Columbia University and a 2023--2024 job market candidate. I previously received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from the University of Hong Kong. My research interests include Applied Microeconomics, Family Economics and Health and Education.

My <a href="/files/JMP.pdf" target="_blank">job market paper</a> examines the effect of newly available information on lead service lines (lead pipes) on housing prices in Washington, D.C., and assesses the effect of the release as a public health policy.

I strive to use my economics training to make real-world impact, and hope to broaden my perspective by working with people from different backgrounds and with different skill sets.
